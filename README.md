# Mental AID By team Data-Doctors | UN World Innovation Day Hackathon | 2021

## Motivation
As stated by the UN that in every 2 second “someone aged 30 to 70 years dies prematurely from noncommunicable diseases - cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes or cancer.” The motivation behind this kind of model is to help the community to reduce or ideally solve social conditions that could play a detrimental role towards those with mental health conditions. We rely on the government to solve a lot of socially related problem areas, but when it comes to mental health conditions, sometimes just being part of the community can make an individual feel less anxious, in sync with the community, and control of their life. Suppose we can get organizations within a community to partner and host activities that range from putting together a farmer’s market in a food desert to extending bus routes in a region with no access to public transportation. In that case, we believe that we could impact some of the extensive health conditions that are ripple effects of an individual’s lifestyle. We saw this firsthand when organizations in the community partnered with the state governments in the USA to set up COVID vaccination sites, and yet everyone working those sites was volunteers.

## Description 
Our solution MentalAID aims to inform community leaders about how Social Determinants of Health drive mental health vulnerabilities at different geographic levels. From this point forward, the community leaders can make data-driven decisions and collaborate with other organizations/partnerships within the community to host events that will ideally reduce some of the social factors that could be a driving force for individuals’ mental health conditions. 
We have catered our solution to two different classes of users:  

### 1. Community leaders/ Gyms/ Recreation Centers/ Rehabilitation Centers /Other facilities where recreational activities can be held
This class of users will have access to different social-related trends around them so that they can use those trends to set up activities for the community.

### 2. Individuals
The solution will recommend to this class of users activities that may help their social and mental conditions based on their actions. 

Once a user has created an account, every time they open up the app, they are asked a series of questions centered around how they are feeling that day. We can use this additional data to personalize the recommendations based on the user’s likes and dislikes.

Each time a user enters a response, they are rewarded with a token for checking in that day. If the user continues to check in for a set of consecutive days (TBD), the user can either personalize their avatar/character or get a monetary award (like a free Starbucks drink or depending on our partnerships, the reward could change).
